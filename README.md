The tipical snake game with Java Swing. In this project I did not want to do it dificult, I use the tipical JButtons and the game logic is change the colors. With this project you can see the logic if you want to do one for you, other examples use Graphics and I think , if you are searching a easy project to learn, don't spend more time and clone the project!
