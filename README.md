The tipical snake game with Java Swing. 
In this project I did't want to do dificult, I use the tipical JButtons and 
the logic game is change the colors. With this project you can see the logic
if you want to do one for you, other examples use Graphics and I think , if you
are searching a easy project to learn, don't spend more time and clone the project!
